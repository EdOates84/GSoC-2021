# Show-Segmentation
GSoC 2021 project with Red Hen Lab. I want to improve the clustering algorithm to the in-production code and enhance the previous work. The main problem is to find the correct anchor. Currently, the most time-consuming process in the program is going frame by frame and extracting faces. The face-recognition method used in the production code processes each frame individually. I want to upgrade it to a parallelized algorithm to process multiple frames in a batch and increase the processing speed exponentially, which will also help in faster testing of hyperparameters. Batch processing can be much quicker than processing single images at a time. So I think we use batch processing for multi-threading.
